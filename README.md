## Overview:
Every year, millions of basketball fans root for their favorite NBA teams as they try to predict final playoffs brackets. While people usually have a sense of how good a team is based on its players, we wanted to find a way to utilize neural networks to predict the outcome of the playoffs for a given season. Therefore, for this project, we constructed a neural network capable of taking in data from the regular season of an NBA season and predicting the winner of an NBA game given 2 teams. So to emulate the playoff bracket, we simply run the model however many times we need to create a completed bracket, eventually crowning a champion.
